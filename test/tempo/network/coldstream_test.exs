  # Coldstream's Corinthian Geometric sequence, modelled with date-ranges
  # and an overlap synchronism — Levy et al. (2020), Fig. 5c (after
  # Coldstream 2008). It demonstrates regional ceramic phases joined by
  # an `:overlaps` relation rather than a strict sequence, where each
  # style's date range is approximate. Years are BCE (negative).
  #
  # The paper presents Fig. 5 as input-modelling options and does not
  # publish a tightened table, so the bounds asserted here are
  # hand-derived from the constraints and confirmed against the solver.
