  # WKST changes how FREQ=WEEKLY+BYDAY partitions occurrences
  # into weeks. With the default WKST=MO (1), the week is
  # Mon..Sun; with WKST=SU (7), the week is Sun..Sat. For most
  # BYDAY expansions at the per-week level the set of dates
  # produced in a month or year is identical — only the
  # *grouping* into weeks differs. That grouping matters when
  # BYSETPOS picks the Nth element of a per-week candidate set.
