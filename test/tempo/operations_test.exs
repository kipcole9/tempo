  #   4. Cross-axis (bound-based materialisation)
  #   5. Algebraic identities — ∅ ∪ A = A, De Morgan's laws, etc.

  # 7. Member-preserving sweep vs the naive quadratic reference.
  #
  # `members_overlapping/2` and `members_outside/2` are implemented as
  # an O(n + m) merge-sweep over the from-sorted member lists. These
  # properties pin the sweep to the definitionally-obvious O(n × m)
  # reference (every A member against every B member via the full
  # Allen relation), over sets whose members overlap, nest, touch,
  # and duplicate — the shapes that stress the sweep's sortedness
  # assumptions.
