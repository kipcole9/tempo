defmodule Tempo.Network.ChronoLog do
  @moduledoc """
  Decode a ChronoLog `.clog` file (the JSON export of ChronoLog 3) into
  a `t:Tempo.Network.t/0`.

  ChronoLog (Levy et al. 2020) is the reference implementation of the
  chronological-network scheme Tempo's `Tempo.Network` adopts. Its
  saved models — sequences of periods, lone periods, events, and the
  synchronisms between them — exercise the same Simple Temporal Problem
  the Tempo solver builds, so a published ChronoLog model is an
  independent oracle for validating Tempo's network code.

  This decoder reads the case-study `.clog` files bundled under
  `test/support/data/chronolog/` and is used only by the test suite; it
  is not part of Tempo's public API.

  ## Mapping

  A period's `durationLB`/`durationUB` become a Tempo duration bound.
  An event is a zero-duration period pinned to its `dateLB`..`dateUB`
  window. A `sequence` becomes a gap-free `Tempo.Network.add_sequence/2`.

  Synchronisms map to `Tempo.Network.Relation` types — the qualitative
  relations directly, the boundary inequalities to the `{:boundary, …}`
  relation, and delay synchronisms to the metric `{:delay, …}` relation.

  ## Provenance of the constraint semantics

  Each synchronism's exact constraint was read from the ChronoLog 3
  bytecode (`com.chronolog.synchronisms.*.update/3`). A delay
  synchronism with `beforeAfter: "a"` constrains `boundary1` of
  `period1` to lie `delay` units **after** `boundary2` of `period2`,
  with `mostLeast` selecting `==` (`"e"`), `≥` (`"l"`), or `≤` (`"m"`).
