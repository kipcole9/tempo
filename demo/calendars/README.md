# Launch demo calendars

Two fictional calendars for April 2026, built to exercise Tempo's iCalendar import and set-algebra operations during the launch demo.

## Characters

**Bruce Thompson** — Sydney-based product manager at a growth-stage SaaS company. Weekend rugby with the Randwick Colts, crime-fiction book club, craft beer, fishing with Dad. 82 events once the recurring items expand.

**Shiela Reyes** — Sydney solicitor on the equity-partner track. Hot yoga twice a week, a pottery course, wine-tasting evening class, bushwalking with girlfriends, Women's book club. 67 events once the recurring items expand.

## What they demonstrate

* **Workday overlaps** — Bruce and Shiela both work 9-to-5ish. Some meetings overlap (the demo's intersection query hits ~35), most don't. Realistic for two independent professionals.

* **Shared social events** — four actual joint engagements: Sam's 35th birthday drinks (Fri Apr 3), BBQ at Tom & Claire's (Sat Apr 4), Tom & Claire's wedding (Sat Apr 18), and the ANZAC Day dawn service (Sat Apr 25 — same memorial, not a planned meet-up).

* **Weekend divergence** — Bruce's Saturdays are rugby training/matches and fishing/BBQ; Shiela's are bushwalks, the farmers' market, a yoga retreat, and art galleries. Their interests are plausibly separate.

* **Recurring patterns** — daily standups (Bruce), weekly partners' meetings (Shiela), Mon/Wed/Fri gym, Tue/Thu yoga, weekly pottery classes. Good material for `Tempo.RRule` expansion.

* **Calendar-quarter queries** — both sit entirely inside Q2 2026, so `Tempo.intersection(bruce, ~o"2026Y2Q")` narrows cleanly.

## Format notes

Events use `DTSTART;TZID=Australia/Sydney:…` and the file carries a matching `VTIMEZONE` block. The `ical` 2.0 library only populates the event's datetime fields when a `Calendar.TimeZoneDatabase` is installed — this project pulls in `tz` as a dev/test dependency and points `config/dev.exs` and `config/test.exs` at `Tz.TimeZoneDatabase` so the demo calendars round-trip without workarounds. Consumers running `mix test` or an iex session inside the project will see each event anchored to `Australia/Sydney` with the correct UTC offset (AEDT until 5 April, AEST from 6 April onwards).

## Quick demo lines

```elixir
{:ok, bruce}  = Tempo.ICal.from_ical(File.read!("demo/calendars/bruce.ics"))
{:ok, shiela} = Tempo.ICal.from_ical(File.read!("demo/calendars/shiela.ics"))

# When are they both busy?
{:ok, clash} = Tempo.intersection(bruce, shiela)

# What workday time do they share? Narrow each to workdays first.
april = ~o"2026Y4M"
{:ok, bruce_weekdays}  = Tempo.select(bruce,  Tempo.workdays(:AU))
{:ok, shiela_weekdays} = Tempo.select(shiela, Tempo.workdays(:AU))

# Find Bruce's free time: his April minus his busy events.
{:ok, bruce_free} = Tempo.difference(april, bruce)

# Mutual free slots for a catch-up coffee.
{:ok, shiela_free} = Tempo.difference(april, shiela)
{:ok, mutual_free} = Tempo.intersection(bruce_free, shiela_free)
```
