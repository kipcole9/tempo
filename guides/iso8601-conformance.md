# ISO 8601 Conformance Guide

Tempo implements a substantial subset of [ISO 8601:2019](https://www.iso.org/standard/70907.html) Part 1 and [ISO 8601-2:2019](https://www.iso.org/standard/70908.html) Part 2, plus the [IETF IXDTF draft (draft-ietf-sedate-datetime-extended-09)](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-sedate-datetime-extended-09.html). This guide catalogues what is supported, what isn't, and where Tempo diverges from the strict standard.

The canonical authority is the PDF of the ISO standard (held locally in `~/Documents/Development/iso_standards/`). When this document and the standard disagree, the standard wins — please file an issue.

## 1. Core principle — bounded intervals

Every Tempo value is a **bounded interval on the time line**, not an instant. `2026-01` is not the single instant "January 2026"; it is the interval `[2026-01-01, 2026-02-01)` — inclusive of the first boundary, exclusive of the last. This is called the **implicit-span semantics**: a partial date specification spans the next-finer unit that isn't given.

A single `Tempo.from_iso8601/1` call therefore always returns a bounded value, never a "partial" or "unresolved" date. This lets the set operations (`Tempo.union/2`, `intersection/2`, `difference/2`, and interval-set coalescing) reason about every value uniformly.

## 2. ISO 8601 Part 1 — core representations

### Two forms, three spellings: implicit and explicit

ISO 8601 lets you write the *same* value more than one way. The choice runs on two independent axes — worth knowing both, because **Tempo accepts all of them as input but always prints the explicit form**: `inspect(~o"2022-06-15")` shows `~o"2022Y6M15D"`, which surprises people the first time.

**Axis 1 — what identifies each component (the *form*).**

* **Implicit form** — a component's identity is implied by its **position**. In `2022-06-15`, `06` is the month because it sits in the month slot. This is the everyday form, defined in ISO 8601 Part 1.

* **Explicit form** — each component carries a **designator letter** naming it: `Y` year, `M` month, `D` day, `W` week, and after the `T`, `H` hour, `M` minute, `S` second. `2022Y6M15D` needs no fixed positions because every field is labelled. Defined in ISO 8601 Part 2.

**Axis 2 — separators (the *format*; applies to the implicit form only).**

* **Extended format** — components separated by `-` and `:`: `2022-06-15`, `T14:30:00`. The human-readable default.

* **Basic format** — no separators: `20220615`, `T143000`. Compact, for fixed-width contexts (filenames, identifiers).

The explicit form needs no separators — the designators already say which field is which — so "basic vs extended" is a property of the implicit form. That yields **three concrete spellings** of any value:

| Value | Implicit · extended | Implicit · basic | Explicit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 15 June 2022 | `2022-06-15` | `20220615` | `2022Y6M15D` |
| 14:30:00 | `T14:30:00` | `T143000` | `T14H30M0S` |
| that date **and** time | `2022-06-15T14:30:00` | `20220615T143000` | `2022Y6M15DT14H30M0S` |

All three parse to the identical `%Tempo{}`; `Tempo.to_iso8601/1`, `inspect/1`, and the `~o` sigil all emit the explicit form.

**Why Tempo prints explicit form.** It is self-describing and order-independent, so it round-trips unambiguously — and it is the only form in which Tempo's richer constructs (durations like `P1Y6M`, groups, selections, and the recurrence designators) compose. It is also why the same letter `M` can mean both **month** and **minute**: the `T` beginning the time part disambiguates them. Before the `T`, `M` is a month (`6M` in `2022Y6M15D` = June); after it, `M` is a minute (`30M` in `T14H30M` = thirty minutes) — the same rule durations use (`P6M` is six months, `PT6M` is six minutes).

**Which should you write?** Prefer **implicit extended** (`2022-06-15T14:30`) for input — it is the most familiar and what most other systems emit. Reach for **explicit** only when you need what it uniquely offers: position independence, or Tempo's extended group/selection syntax.

### Partial or divergent

* **Truncated representations** (`--06-15`, `85-06-15` — 2-digit year) were deprecated in the 2019 edition and are not accepted. Modernise your input.

* **Fractional seconds** are preserved as a `:microsecond {value, precision}` component (not truncated to whole seconds). The digit count is significant — `T10:30:00.120` is millisecond resolution and `T10:30:00.12` is centisecond resolution, two distinct interval widths. ISO 8601 permits an unbounded number of fractional digits; Tempo caps precision at 6 (microsecond), matching Elixir's `Time`/`DateTime`. Input with more than 6 fractional digits is truncated to microsecond. Fractional minutes and hours (`T10:30,5`, `T10,5`) still cascade to a coarser-unit remainder as before.

### Not supported

* Nothing known to be missing from Part 1 as of v0.2.0.

### Not supported

| Feature | Example | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-endpoint semantic validation of intervals | `2012-24/2012-21` (winter before spring) | Parses at the syntax level; a semantic ordering check across the two endpoints is not currently enforced, so a small number of syntactically-valid but semantically-inverted intervals are accepted. |

All other EDTF Level 2 features — including wide-range exponent years (`Y17E8`, `Y-170000002`) and long-year significant-digit annotations (`Y171010000S3`) — are supported.

### Component qualification (ISO 8601-2 §8)

A `?` (uncertain), `~` (approximate), or `%` (both) qualifier's **position** sets its scope, per §8.2. Tempo honours all three scopes for implicit-form dates, storing whole-value qualification on `:qualification` and per-component qualification on the `:qualifications` map (keyed by unit):

| Position | §8 scope | Example | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rightmost end | §8.2.1 **complete** | `2004-06-11%` | `qualification: :uncertain_and_approximate` |
| Right of a component | §8.2.2 **group** — that component and every coarser one to its left | `2004-06~-11` | `qualifications: %{year: :approximate, month: :approximate}` |
| Left of a component | §8.2.3 **individual** — that component only | `2004-?06-11` | `qualifications: %{month: :uncertain}` |
| Leading (left of the first component) | §8.2.3 **individual** | `?2004-06-11` | `qualifications: %{year: :uncertain}` |

Overlapping qualifiers on one component combine: `2004-?06~-11` (individual `?` on the month, group `~` on the month and year) yields `%{year: :approximate, month: :uncertain_and_approximate}`.

The **explicit** (designator) form is also parsed: a qualifier between a value and its designator (`2004~Y6?M11D`, §8.3, including a qualified BC year `2004~YB`) is always individual. `inspect/1` and `to_iso8601/1` render the `:qualifications` map back in this form, so component qualification **round-trips** — a parsed group such as `2004-06~-11` re-encodes as the equivalent explicit individual qualifiers `2004~Y6~M11D`. Per §8.2.4, a value whose every present component shares one qualifier collapses to the compact complete form (`2004%Y6%M11%D` → `2004Y6M11D%`); group collapse is not attempted, as the explicit output form has no group representation.

## 4. IXDTF — Internet Extended Date/Time Format

Tempo implements the [IXDTF draft](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-sedate-datetime-extended-09.html) suffix syntax. After any ISO 8601 date-time, an optional suffix may carry:

| Suffix | Example | Stored on `%Tempo{}` |
|---|---|---|
| IANA time zone | `[Europe/Paris]` | `extended.zone_id` |
| Numeric offset | `[+08:45]`, `[-03:30]`, `[+0530]` | `extended.zone_offset` (minutes from UTC) |
| Calendar (`u-ca=`) | `[u-ca=hebrew]`, `[u-ca=gregory]` | `extended.calendar` (atom) |
| Generic tag | `[_foo=bar-baz]` | `extended.tags` (`%{"key" => ["value", ...]}`) |

Each bracket may be prefixed with `!` to mark it **critical**. Unrecognised critical tags cause the parse to fail; unrecognised elective tags are retained verbatim in `extended.tags`.

A critical flag on a *time zone* also triggers RFC 9557 §4.2 offset consistency: `2022-01-01T00:00:00+05:00[!America/New_York]` is rejected with a `Tempo.ZoneOffsetMismatchError` because `+05:00` is not New York's offset on that date. Marking the zone critical is retained on `extended.zone_critical` and round-trips back out through `to_iso8601/1`. An *elective* zone leaves the numeric offset authoritative and the zone advisory, so a disagreement parses cleanly. To reject disagreement even for elective zones, pass `strict: true` to `from_iso8601/2` — a superset of the mandatory critical check.

Time zones are validated against the configured time zone database (`Tempo.TimeZoneDatabase.zone_exists?/1`); with no database configured, syntactically valid zone names are accepted without registry validation. Calendars are validated against `Localize.validate_calendar/1`, which also handles the `"gregory"` → `:gregorian` alias per BCP 47.

## 5. Project-specific extensions (not in ISO 8601)

These syntaxes are Tempo conveniences, not part of any standard:

* **Step in range** — `{1990..1999//2}Y` or `2023Y{1..-1//2}W` means "every second week in 2023".
* **Explicit suffixes** — `2022Y11M20D` instead of `2022-11-20`. Used by the `~o` sigil as the canonical output form.
* **Repeat rule** — `/F` combinator inside a parsed expression.
* **Selection instance count** — `L…N` with an `I` modifier for the nth instance of a *single* weekday (`2I1K` = "the 2nd Monday"). `I` is ISO 8601-2, not a Tempo invention; it is mentioned here only to contrast it with `V` below, which it is easily confused with.

None of these break ISO 8601 compatibility — Tempo accepts the standard forms too.

### Ratified RRULE selection designators — `V` and `Q`

A recurrence selection may carry two RFC 5545 (iCalendar RRULE / cron) filters that have **no ISO 8601 representation**: `BYSETPOS` and `WKST`. Tempo gives them project-specific designators — `V` and `Q` — so a rule that uses them round-trips through `inspect/1` and `Tempo.to_iso8601/1` instead of being silently lost. These are **ratified** as permanent extensions: the letters and their meanings are stable and will not change.

They are kept, rather than dropped for the sake of a spec-pure output, for two reasons:

1. They express selections that ISO 8601 genuinely cannot. Neither the ISO ordinal designator `I` nor Tempo's set operations (`Tempo.intersection/2`, `Tempo.difference/2`, …) can reproduce them — see the contrasts below.

2. They give Tempo's native string form the same reach as the RRULE it parses, so `RRULE → to_iso8601 → from_iso8601 → to_rrule` is loss-free and symmetric with the recurrence vocabulary.

#### `V` — set position (RRULE `BYSETPOS`)

`nV` keeps the **Nth occurrence of the whole per-period candidate set**, after every other `BY`-rule has run and the survivors are sorted. Negative counts index from the end and a set picks several: `-1V` is the last, `{1,3}V` is the 1st and 3rd.

The subtlety — and the reason it is more than the ordinary ordinal — is that it ranks the *merged* set, not one weekday. "The last **weekday** of the month" is `V`; "the last **Friday**" is the ISO ordinal `I`. They are different selections:

```elixir
# Last WEEKDAY of each month — R/../P1M/FL{1..5}K-1VN
# -1V over the merged Mon–Fri set
Tempo.RRule.parse!("FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYSETPOS=-1")
#   from 2022-06 → June 30 (Thu), July 29 (Fri), Aug 31 (Wed)

# Last FRIDAY of each month — the ISO ordinal `I`, a genuinely different result
Tempo.RRule.parse!("FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=-1FR")
#   from 2022-06 → June 24, July 29, Aug 26
```

They coincide only when the last weekday happens to be a Friday (July, above). RFC 5545's own worked example — "the third instance of Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday each month" — is `3V`:

```elixir
# R/../P1M/FL{2..4}K3VN
Tempo.RRule.parse!("FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=TU,WE,TH;BYSETPOS=3")
#   from 1997-09 → Sept 4, Oct 7, Nov 6
```

#### `Q` — week start (RRULE `WKST`)

`nQ` sets the weekday a week **begins** on (`1Q` = Monday, the default; `7Q` = Sunday). Because ISO 8601 weeks start on Monday by definition, any other week start has no ISO representation. The designator is emitted only when it is *not* the Monday default.

`WKST` is a no-op for most rules: it changes nothing for `FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1`, since one day per week is picked wherever the boundary sits. It becomes observable only when the week boundary decides *which* weeks are on — an `INTERVAL` of two or more, or a `BYWEEKNO`. This is RFC 5545's canonical example, with the week start as the only difference:

```elixir
# Every other week, Tue + Sun, from Tue 1997-08-05
Tempo.RRule.parse!("FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2;COUNT=4;BYDAY=TU,SU;WKST=MO")
#   → Aug 5, 10, 19, 24   (R4/../P2W/FL{2,7}KN — no Q, Monday is the default)

Tempo.RRule.parse!("FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2;COUNT=4;BYDAY=TU,SU;WKST=SU")
#   → Aug 5, 17, 19, 31   (R4/../P2W/FL{2,7}K7QN)
```

Moving the week start from Monday to Sunday changes which fortnight each candidate falls in, so a different set of dates survives the `INTERVAL=2` filter.

#### Interchange risk

`V` and `Q` are the **only** non-standard letters Tempo emits inside a selection. Because they are not ISO 8601, a *different* system reading Tempo's ISO string would not understand them. We rate this risk **low**: we have not identified any other system that consumes ISO 8601-2 recurrence at all, let alone one a Tempo `V`/`Q` string would reach in practice. Where a standard interchange form is needed — sharing a rule with a calendar server, for instance — use `Tempo.to_rrule/1`, which emits `BYSETPOS`/`WKST` in their portable RFC 5545 spelling. Treat the `V`/`Q` string as Tempo's native, loss-free persistence form and the RRULE string as the wire format.

## 6. Ambiguity resolution

A few ISO 8601 constructs are genuinely ambiguous; Tempo resolves them as follows.

| Construct | Standard says | Tempo does |
|---|---|---|
| Seasons `21-24` | Hemisphere unspecified | Treated as **Northern meteorological** (`21` = spring = March-May). |
| `Z` without offset | "UTC is known, local offset unknown" (per RFC 5322 / IXDTF) | Stored as `shift: [hour: 0]`. No distinction from `+00:00`. |
| `-00:00` | ISO 8601:2000 forbade; ISO 8601:2019 permits | Permitted; equivalent to `Z`. |
| Leading qualifier on a date (`?2022-06-15`) | §8.2.3: left of a component qualifies that component | Individual qualification of the leftmost (coarsest) component — `?2022-06-15` stamps `%{year: :uncertain}` on `:qualifications`, not the whole value. See §3 "Component qualification". |

## 7. Test coverage

Tempo's conformance is exercised by:

* **`test/tempo/iso8601/dates_times_test.exs`** — Part 1 core representations.
* **`test/tempo/iso8601/duration_test.exs`**, **`interval_test.exs`**, **`set_test.exs`** — interval, duration, and set constructs.
* **`test/tempo/iso8601/extended_test.exs`** — IXDTF suffix parsing.
* **`test/tempo/iso8601/qualification_test.exs`** — EDTF L1 and L2 qualification.
* **`test/tempo/iso8601/open_interval_test.exs`** — open-ended intervals.
* **`test/tempo/iso8601/unspecified_digit_test.exs`** — unspecified-digit masks.
* **`test/tempo/iso8601/leap_second_test.exs`** — leap-second validation.
* **`test/tempo/iso8601/round_trip_test.exs`** — one representative per token round-trips through `inspect/1`: parse a value, re-parse the canonical `~o"…"` form `inspect/1` shows, and get the identical value back — no component dropped or mangled.
* **`test/tempo/iso8601/edtf_corpus_test.exs`** — the full `unt-libraries/edtf-validate` corpus (BSD-3-Clause), exercised at 100%. See `test/support/edtf_corpus.ex` for the raw strings and attribution.

The EDTF corpus is the only publicly-available conformance test set we know of for ISO 8601-2 Part 2; Tempo passes it in full.

## 8. Comparison to other implementations

No other known implementation in any language supports **full** ISO 8601 Parts 1 and 2. The RFC 3339 subset is covered by every mainstream date library (`java.time`, `chrono`, Python `datetime`, etc.). Part 2 — sets, groups, uncertainty, seasons, selections — is covered only by the EDTF family of libraries (`python-edtf`, `edtf.js`, `edtf-validate`, `mbklein/nulib` for Elixir), which themselves target EDTF's subset of the 2019 standard. Tempo's Part 2 coverage is roughly equivalent to EDTF Level 2 plus Tempo-specific extensions (groups, selections, step ranges).

See `docs/iso8601-conformance-research.md` for the detailed prior-art survey.

## 9. Reporting a conformance gap

If you have an ISO 8601 or EDTF string that should parse and doesn't, please open an issue including:

* The input string.
* The expected result (cite the ISO 8601 clause or EDTF level).
* The actual output from `Tempo.from_iso8601/1`.

Pull requests with a failing test case are especially welcome.
