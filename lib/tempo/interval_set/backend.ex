defmodule Tempo.IntervalSet.Backend do
  @moduledoc """
  The behaviour a `Tempo.IntervalSet` storage backend implements.

  An interval set's representation is pluggable: the set struct carries a
  `:backend` module and an opaque backend `state` (in its `:intervals`
  field), and every `Tempo.IntervalSet` function reaches the members
  through this contract rather than assuming a concrete data structure.
  `Tempo.IntervalSet.Backend.List` — a sorted plain list — is the default
  and the reference implementation.

  ## The contract

  The universal primitive is the **ordered walk**: `walk/1` returns an
  enumerable that yields the member intervals in time order, sorted by
  `from` endpoint, disjoint, each half-open `[from, to)`. A backend is
  correct as soon as it can walk; the remaining callbacks exist so a
  backend can answer common questions without a full walk, and default
  to walk-derived implementations via `use Tempo.IntervalSet.Backend`.

  `bounded?/1` is the honesty bit: a backend over a finite member list
  returns `true`; a lazy backend over a potentially unbounded generator
  returns `false`, and aggregate operations (`to_list/1`, `count/1`,
  set-wide duration) refuse rather than walk forever. Callers must
  consult `bounded?/1` before calling `to_list/1` or `count/1`.

  ## Implementing a backend

      defmodule MyBackend do
        use Tempo.IntervalSet.Backend

        @impl true
        def from_list(intervals, _options), do: build_my_state(intervals)

        @impl true
        def to_list(state), do: my_state_to_list(state)

        @impl true
        def walk(state), do: my_lazy_stream(state)

        @impl true
        def bounded?(_state), do: true
      end

  `use` provides overridable `count/1`, `empty?/1`, and `first/1`
  derived from `to_list/1` and `walk/1`; override them when the
  representation can answer faster (a tree knows its size; any backend
  can peek its first member without materialising).

  Construct a set on a specific backend with
  `Tempo.IntervalSet.new(intervals, backend: MyBackend)`. Set operations
  preserve the backend of member-preserving results; newly constructed
  extents default to the list backend.
