defmodule Tempo.Interval.Composition do

  # Allen's interval-algebra composition table (J. F. Allen, "Maintaining
  # Knowledge about Temporal Intervals", CACM 26(11), 1983, Fig. 4).
  #
  # Given `A r1 B` and `B r2 C`, `compose(r1, r2)` is the set of Allen
  # relations that can hold between `A` and `C`. Each cell is the exact set of
  # relations `r3` for which some assignment of the six interval endpoints
  # satisfies `r1(A, B) ∧ r2(B, C) ∧ r3(A, C)` under the half-open convention —
  # derived from the endpoint encoding by a difference-bound consistency check
  # (the same reasoning `Tempo.Network.Solver.relation/3` performs) and checked
  # cell-for-cell against a fresh derivation, and spot-checked against the
  # published table, in the test suite.
  #
  # Relations within a cell are listed in Allen's canonical order. Lookup is a
  # constant-time nested-map read — no solver runs at call time.
