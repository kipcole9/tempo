defmodule Tempo.Schedule.Slot do
  @moduledoc """
  A solved task in a `Tempo.Schedule` — when the task is scheduled and
  how much room it has to move.

  `start`/`finish` are the *early* schedule (the earliest the task can
  begin and end); `latest_start`/`latest_finish` are the *late* schedule
  (the latest it can begin and end without making the plan infeasible).
  A task is on the **critical path** when its early and late starts
  coincide — it has zero slack, so any slip delays the whole project (a
  task pinned by an anchor counts: it cannot move at all).

  The late schedule and `critical?` are determined only when something
  bounds how late the task can run — a deadline downstream, or an anchor
  on the task itself. When nothing does, `latest_start`/`latest_finish`
  and `critical?` are `nil`: the early start is known, but the task's
  latest position is open.
