defmodule Tempo.LeapSeconds do
  @moduledoc """
  The canonical list of positive leap seconds announced by the
  International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service
  (IERS) since the UTC–TAI framework began in 1972.

  A leap second is inserted as `23:59:60` at the end of either
  June 30 or December 31 UTC. The values below are the official
  IERS Bulletin C insertion dates; there have been 27 positive
  leap seconds to date and no negative ones.

  This module drives `Tempo.Validation`'s acceptance of `:second
  60` values — ISO 8601 permits `23:59:60` syntactically, but a
  real instant at `23:59:60` only exists on the days listed here.

  The data is static; IERS publishes new bulletins twice a year,
  and when a new leap second is announced (or negative ones
  adopted — the CGPM agreed in 2022 to phase leap seconds out by
  2035) the list should be extended and a new Tempo release cut.

  Return `true` when a positive leap second was inserted at the

  day).

  ### Arguments

  * `year`, `month`, `day` are integers. Month must be 6 or 12
    and day must be 30 or 31 respectively for any leap second to
    have been possible — other inputs return `false`.
