defmodule Tempo.Network.Relation do
  @moduledoc """
  A chronological relation — a constraint between the boundaries of two
  time-periods.

  Relations are stored as data and translated to atomic Simple Temporal
  Problem constraints (`b₁ − b₂ ≤ k`) during normalisation. The
  vocabulary follows ChronoLog (Levy et al. 2020, Tables 1–5) and maps
  onto Allen's interval algebra where an Allen relation exists; the
  *metric* (delay) relations carry an integer offset Allen does not
  express.

  ### Relation types

  Qualitative (no parameters):

  * `:contemporary` — `A` and `B` overlap (non-empty intersection).

  * `:includes` / `:included_in` — `A` contains / is contained by `B`.

  * `:overlaps` / `:overlapped_by` — `A` overlaps and precedes /
    follows `B` (a shared extent, neither containing the other).

  * `:starts_during` / `:includes_start` — `A`'s start falls within
    `B` / `B`'s start falls within `A`.

  * `:ends_during` / `:includes_end` — `A`'s end falls within `B` /
    `B`'s end falls within `A`.

  * `:before` / `:after` — `A` is strictly before / after `B`
    (no overlap).

  * `:immediately_precedes` / `:immediately_follows` — `end(A)=start(B)`
    and the dual.

  * `:synchronous_start` / `:synchronous_end` — shared start / end
    boundary (in either direction; the loose form of Allen's
    `starts`/`started_by` and `finishes`/`finished_by`).

  * `:starts` / `:started_by` — `A` and `B` share a start boundary and
    `A` ends no later than / no earlier than `B` (Allen's `starts` /
    `started_by`).

  * `:finishes` / `:finished_by` — `A` and `B` share an end boundary
    and `A` starts no earlier than / no later than `B` (Allen's
    `finishes` / `finished_by`).

  * `:strictly_contemporary` — `A` and `B` share a non-empty *interior*
    (overlap of positive extent, not merely a touching boundary).

  * `:equals` — identical start and end.

  Metric (parameterised by a duration and a comparison):

  * `{:delay, edge_a, edge_b, comparison, duration}` — the `edge_a`
    boundary of `A` is `comparison` (`:exactly` | `:at_least` |
    `:at_most`) `duration` before the `edge_b` boundary of `B`, where
    each edge is `:start` or `:end`.

  Boundary (a single comparison between one boundary of each period):

  * `{:boundary, edge_a, comparison, edge_b}` — the `edge_a` boundary of
    `A` is `comparison` the `edge_b` boundary of `B`, where `comparison`
    is `:before` (strictly), `:at_or_before`, `:coincident` (equal),
    `:at_or_after`, or `:after` (strictly). This is the complete
    boundary-inequality lattice: any of ChronoLog's "starts/ends
    before/after/at the start/end of" synchronisms is one such relation
    (e.g. `{:boundary, :end, :at_or_before, :start}` is "ends before or
    at the start of").

  Translate a relation into its atomic STP constraints.

  Each constraint has the single shape `from − to ≤ weight` (ISO of the

  integer time-scale becomes `≤ -1`; a metric (delay) relation carries a
  duration weight that normalisation later resolves to an integer.
