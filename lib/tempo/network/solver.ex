defmodule Tempo.Network.Solver do
  @moduledoc """
  Consistency checking and bound tightening for a chronological
  network, by solving its Simple Temporal Problem.

  The network normalises (`Tempo.Network.Normalize`) to a directed
  weighted graph — one node per boundary plus the origin `z₀` — whose
  all-pairs shortest paths are the **minimal network**: the tightest
  bound on `b₁ − b₂` is the shortest-path weight `b₁ → b₂` (Dechter,
  Meiri & Pearl 1991; the paper's Floyd 1962). The network is
  **consistent** iff the graph has no negative cycle.

  * `consistent?/1` — does any valid assignment of dates exist?

  * `tighten/1` — the narrowest start, end, and duration each period can
    take given every constraint together.

  * `contemporaneity/3` — whether two periods can, must, or cannot overlap.

  * `relation/3` — the tightest Allen relation(s) still possible between two
    periods, with `relation_certainty/4` for a single named relation.

  These all run in O(n³) on the boundary count (Floyd–Warshall), which is
  interactive for the hundreds of periods these chronologies contain.

  Classify whether two periods overlap in time, given the whole network.

  Returns `:certain` when the constraints force the periods to be
  contemporary, `:possible` when they merely allow it, and `:impossible`
  when they forbid it. The verdict is read from the minimal (tightened)
  network, so it accounts for every constraint — not just the two
  periods' own bounds — in the spirit of Geeraerts, Levy & Pluquet,
  *Models and Algorithms for Chronology* (TIME 2017), Props. 7 and 10.

  Two periods that merely touch (one ends exactly where the other
  begins) count as contemporary, matching `add_relation(:contemporary,
  …)` — the endpoints are treated as closed here.

  ### Arguments

  * `network` is a `t:Tempo.Network.t/0`.

  * `p1` and `p2` are ids of periods present in the network.

  ### Returns

  * `:certain` when every valid chronology has the periods overlapping;

  * `:possible` when some but not all valid chronologies do;

  * `:impossible` when none do; or

  * `{:error, :inconsistent}` when the network has no valid chronology.

  The Allen interval relation(s) still possible between two periods, given
  every constraint in the network.

  Generalises `contemporaneity/3` from the single overlap question to the full
  relational answer, in the same vocabulary `Tempo.relation/2` uses for
  grounded values. It reads off the **minimal network** — the same solved
  shortest-path distances `contemporaneity/3` and `tighten/1` use — so it costs
  no extra solve: a relation is possible iff adding its endpoint constraints to
  the solved network stays consistent (no negative cycle). No qualitative
  disjunction enters, so it remains polynomial.

  Periods are treated as proper intervals (start strictly before end), matching
  Tempo's no-degenerate-intervals ontology, and endpoints are compared
  half-open — so "the end of A coincides with the start of B" is `:meets`, not
  overlap. (That boundary case is still `possibly_contemporary?/3`, which asks
  the looser "could they have coexisted" question.)

  ### Arguments

  * `network` is a `t:Tempo.Network.t/0`.

  * `p1` and `p2` are period identifiers added with `Tempo.Network.add_period/3`.

  ### Returns

  * A single Allen relation atom (e.g. `:during`) when the constraints pin the
    relation to exactly one — it is *entailed*.

  * A list of atoms (in Allen's canonical order) when several remain possible —
    the tightest qualitative statement the constraints support.

  * `{:error, :inconsistent}` when the network has no valid assignment, or
    `{:error, :unknown_period}` when an id is not in the network.

  Explain a tightened bound as a trace — the chain of constraints that

  Reconstructs the shortest path in the constraint graph that produces
