defmodule Tempo.RequiresAnchorError do
  @moduledoc """
  Exception returned when arithmetic on an un-anchored value (one with
  no `:year`) would depend on the missing year, so it cannot be
  resolved.

  Some un-anchored arithmetic *is* answerable — `~o"1M31D"` shifted by
  one day is `~o"2M1D"`, because January always has 31 days. But
  shifting `~o"1M31D"` by one month lands in February, whose length
  depends on the year, so there is no single answer. In that case
  `Tempo.shift/2` (and the `Tempo.Math` arithmetic beneath it) returns
  `{:error, %Tempo.RequiresAnchorError{}}` rather than guessing or
  crashing.
