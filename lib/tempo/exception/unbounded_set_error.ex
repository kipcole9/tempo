defmodule Tempo.UnboundedSetError do
  @moduledoc """
  Exception raised when an aggregate operation needs every member of
  an interval set whose backend is unbounded (a lazy generator such as
  `Tempo.weekends/1`).

  Unbounded sets support the walking operations — `Enum.take/2`,
  `Tempo.IntervalSet.walk/1`, `covered?/2`, `first/1`, and use as a
  `skipping:` busy set — but any operation whose answer requires the
  whole member list (`to_list/1`, `count/1`, `coalesce/1`, set
  algebra) refuses rather than walking forever. Bound the set first:
  intersect the walk with a finite span, or take the members you need.
